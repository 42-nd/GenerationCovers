# GenerationCovers
I created a dataset and converted the PROGAN architecture to conditional so that it could create images of album covers by genre. I couldn't train her because of the lack of capacity. Anyone who is just interested in this topic or can even train this neural network, use it, but just contact me. There is also a torrent for this marked-up dataset
